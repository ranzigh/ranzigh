# INTRO

My name is Alex. I'm an engineer for building physics. This page contains projects regarding my work aswell as for my personal use that I wanted to share.

### CONSULTING: ENERGY EFFICIENCY

This project contains several tools with the purpose to improve the quality of the planning process of energy efficiency in buildings, according to German law and norms.
- Calculating the best heat source, from a financial and a environmental perspective
- Calculating the energy needed for residential buildings according to German norms.
- Sommerlicher Wärmeschutz: If a room is permitted to be build as planned or is overheating in the summer


### BUY vs. RENT

This project guides ones assumptions on what is cheaper over the long run and should provide decision making aid on wether to buy or rent, from a financiel perspective.
It contains visualizations to better understand the progress over time.

### Crawler with SQL-dump

An ongoing, for now very simple project to scrape data from a website and dump it in an SQL database. Another program can extract the data again and visualize it. This can be displayed on a local HTML page which refreshes itself in a given interval. You can have multiple of these visualizations on one page. You could, for example, display your personal choice of stock prices and refresh the page at your desired range of time. E.g. show DAX, DOW, €/$ and refresh it every 15 minutes. Leave that page open on a second screen and follow your stocks in real time while saving the data in your database. NOTE however, that crawling on most pages requires a written permit from the owner. I actually read the AGB of EBAY for this.
