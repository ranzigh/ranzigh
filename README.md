My name is Alex. I'm an engineer for building physics. This page contains projects regarding my work aswell as for my personal use that I wanted to share.

## CONSULTING: ENERGY EFFICIENCY

This project contains several tools with the purpose to improve the quality of the planning process of energy efficiency in buildings, according to German law and norms.
- Calculating the best heat source, from a financial and a environmental perspective
- Calculating the energy needed for residential buildings according to German norms.
- Sommerlicher WÃ¤rmeschutz: If a room is permitted to be build as planned or is overheating in the summer


## BUY vs. RENT

This project guides ones assumptions on what is cheaper over the long run and should provide decision making aid on wether to buy or rent, from a financiel perspective.
It contains visualizations to better understand the progress over time.
